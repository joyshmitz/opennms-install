üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If you want to learn in detail take a look into the deployment section in our documentation for [OpenNMS Horizon](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/) or [OpenNMS Meridian](https://docs.opennms.com/meridian/latest/).
We have started also to work on Ansible roles for the Ubuntu-based operating systems which you can find at https://github.com/opennms-forge/ansible-opennms.

## üéØ Scope

* Bootstrap a single-node OpenNMS system on RPM or DEB-based systems quickly with the latest stable release
* Installation procedure is close following the best practices from our official docs
* Scripts don't deal with existing installations or upgrades
* Scripts doesn't configure or install Minions, Sentinels, or distributed time series storage like Cortex.
* Users can use the installed system to learn and investigate how to configure OpenNMS Horizon in complex distributed environments which gives them a quick starting point.

## üèÜ Goal

* Give people a way to install OpenNMS Horizon on their system to get familiar with OpenNMS Horizon quickly on a bare metal system.
* Remove the need to know Docker or Ansible to quickly bootstrap an OpenNMS Horizon system.
* Keep it simple and support operating systems based on official packages using RPM and DEB.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

Download the script to your system.

Execute on a CentOS-based system
```bash
sudo bash bootstrap-yum.sh
```

Execute on Debian-based system
```bash
sudo bash bootstrap-debian.sh
```
